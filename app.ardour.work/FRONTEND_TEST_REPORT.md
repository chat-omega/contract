## 14. Recommendations

### Code Quality ✓
The code demonstrates excellent practices:

2. **Reusable components** with proper prop types
3. **Theme context** properly implemented
4. **No hardcoded colors** - all use design tokens

### Suggested Improvements 💡
(Optional, not blocking):

1. **Add visual regression testing:** Consider using tools like Percy or Chromatic for automated visual testing

2. **Document color tokens:** Create a central color palette documentation

3. **Component library:** Consider extracting common styled components (buttons, cards) into a shared library

4. **Dark mode toggle:** While theme infrastructure exists, consider adding a user-accessible toggle

5. **Storybook integration:** Would help visualize all components and their states
